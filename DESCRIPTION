Title: A Path-Based BCD for Proximal Function of Latent Group Lasso
Description: Implementation of the block coordinate descent procedure for
    solving the proximal function of latent group Lasso, highlighted by
    decomposing a DAG into several non-overlapping path graphs, and getting
    closed-form solution for each path graph. The procedure was introduced
    as Algorithm 4 in Yan and Bien (2017) <https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1511838027>
    "Hierarchical Sparse Modeling: A Choice of Two Group Lasso Formulations", and the
    closed-form solution for each path graph is solved in Algorithm 3 of
    that paper.
