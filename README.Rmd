# hsm

The R package implements the algorithm for solving proximal operator of the latent group lasso, introduced as Algorithm 4 in Yan, X. and Bien, J. (2017) ["Hierarchical Sparse Modeling: A Choice of Two Group Lasso Formulations"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01631.pdf).

To install `hsm` using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) R package, type

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("yanxht/hsm", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

in R. This installs `hsm` and builds its vignette. Learn to use `hsm` with its vignette by typing

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("hsm-vignette")
```

in R.
